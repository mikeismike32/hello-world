# hello-world
Just foolin around
My name is Michael. Sometimes I slack off more than I should. It's a really bad habit that I've grown into, and my teachers HATE it!
My goal right now is to pass this class. That's all I want. Maybe I haven't done enough to deserve it, but that's up for you to decide.
This semester was my 4th and final semester at Tri-C and I was a CCP student. I am trasnferring to Akron U in the fall for Cyber Security!
